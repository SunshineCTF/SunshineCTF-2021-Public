I mentioned to a friend of mine from Australia that I like the Game Boy Advance. Apparantly, they had a mysterious cartridge they found at a *Men At Work* concert, and they figured to send it me to figure out what's on it.

However, I have no clue why it keeps referencing a "flag." I ripped it already, but I can't figure out what it's about. Can you help me crack this code?
