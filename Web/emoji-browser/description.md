So, when looking at the feedback for SunshineCTF 2020, I was shocked when I saw an overwhelming
positive response with the presence of emoji! So much so, that the organizers told me to theme a
front-end for some emoji browser challenge. I have no idea what this challenge does, but it seems to
render emoji and nothing else. Seems kind of redundant if that's true.
