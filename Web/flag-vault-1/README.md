# Flag Vault 1

This is a two-step challenge that is primarily RE, but engages with features of web security such as JWTs.

## Deployment

This challenge was built to be deployed using `docker-compose`. Just `docker-compose up` and it should build and come up.

If you want to automate the deployment of this challenge, I have also provided ansible for deployment in the `deploy`.
