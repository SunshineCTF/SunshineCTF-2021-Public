I found my old digital camera with important photos on it, but it won't turn on
any more. I managed to recover some of the image files from its internal flash
memory, but they seem to be all garbled up and unable to be opened on my
computer. I've also found this program from the camera's CD-ROM that has
something to do with converting images, so maybe that will be helpful? Please
help me recover these important images!
