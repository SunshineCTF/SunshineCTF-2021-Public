Lil Chompy found an online quiz on the popular website ChompFeed that tells you
which type of reptile you are when you answer a series of questions. A friend
told him that one of the possible outcomes is "Lil Chompy", but he can't figure
out what answers lead to that result. Can you help him answer the quiz questions
correctly to have an online quiz affirm that he is in fact Lil Chompy?
