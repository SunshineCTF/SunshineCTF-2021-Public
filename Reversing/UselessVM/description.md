# Useless VM

I designed my own virtualized flag storage system a while back. Unfortunately, I
think it may have gotten a bit... rusty.

Challenge contributed by Research Innovations, Inc (RII). Say hi to crandyman if you get a chance!

Note: ARM and Intel binaries available for convenient dynamic analysis. The
hosted challenge is Intel, but the solution should be independent of
architecture.
