btw I've had some difficulty launching the hta directly, if you're getting weird path errors, launch cmd in the directory of the hta, and then launch the hta from that.
otherwise just launch the scripts directly, they're pretty... oh wow... looking at them... they're pretty ugly actually... maybe a refactor is in order. :|
